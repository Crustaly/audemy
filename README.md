# Audemy

Audemy is a collection of educational games aimed at Kindergarten to 5th grade students based on international learning curriculums. Audemy's games are purely audio-based, and require minimal tactile interaction. Furthermore, the games are compatible with assistive technologies such as screen readers.

Over 70% of blind students are at least a grade level behind in school. Audemy aims to increase accessibility for educational resources to blind and visually impaired learners.

## Features

- **Audio-Based Learning**: All games are designed to be played with audio instructions, making them accessible to blind and visually impaired students.
- **Minimal Tactile Interaction**: Games require minimal physical interaction, reducing barriers for students with additional physical disabilities.
- **Assistive Technology Compatibility**: Fully compatible with screen readers and other assistive technologies.

## Impact

- **500+ Students**: We currently work with over 500 blind and visually impaired students.
- **5 States**: Audemy has been used in schools for the blind across 5 states.
- **Research-Backed**: Technology based on research about conversational interfaces for blind and visually impaired, presented at the ACM International Conference on Multimodal Interaction â€˜23 in Paris, France.
